<p>The Rwandan diet consists mainly of sweet potatoes, beans, corn, peas, millet, plantains, cassava, and fruit. The potato is now very popular, thought to have been introduced by German colonists. Rwandans who live in rural areas rarely eat meat.</p>
<p>These are some foods rwanda are known for:</p>
<p>Ugali: This is a paste that is made from maize and water which when mixed together forms a porridge</p> 
<p>Ibihaza: This dish is made from cut-up pumpkin that is mixed with beans and is then boiled</p>
<p>Isombe: This meal combines mashed cassava leaves with dried fish</p>
